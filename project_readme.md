This project is completed in order to fullfill the data science blog post task of udacity data science nanodegree.

I have used the Stackoverflow 2019 survey results as the dataset. The data can be downloaded from: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019

I will investigate the questions below, which are all related to the remote work opinions about the users pre covid-19. I believe that these are interesting questions as they will show what developers feel about remote work before the pandemic:

The project answers 4 business questions:

What was Pre Covid-19 remote work preference percentages of Stackoverflow Community?
How often did Stackoverflow community worked remotely before Covid-19?
What percentage of the survey respondents find remote work options important when deciding on a new job?
Does freelancers have a different opinion about remote work?

My results are published in the blog post here: https://medium.com/@kokturksecil/stackoverflow-communitys-pre-covid-19-opinions-about-remote-work-56a378e9f5e?sk=c0532af5e28bb638bb99254841e3b526

The summary of the analysis:
The developer community loves remote-work, and freelancers love remote work even more!

What was Pre Covid-19 remote work preference percentages of Stackoverflow Community? 79% of the survey respondents answered the question “Where would you prefer to work?”. Of the ones who have answered this question, 58% would like to work in an office, 33% would like to work for home, and 9% would like to work in an other place.

How often did Stackoverflow community worked remotely before Covid-19? 79% of the survey respondents answered the question “How often do you work remotely?”. Of the ones who have answered this question, the results are: Less than once per month / Never 43%, A few days each month 25%, All or almost all the time (I’m full-time remote) 12%, Less than half the time, but at least one day each week 9%, It’s complicated 5%, More than half, but not all, the time 3%, About half the time 3%

What percentage of the survey respondents find remote work options important when deciding on a new job? 89% of the survey respondents answered the question “Imagine that you are deciding between two job offers with the same compensation, benefits, and location. Of the following factors, which 3 are MOST important to you?”.
Out of them, 32% think that remote work options is one the most important three factors when deciding on a job offer with the same ground.

Does freelancers have a different opinion about remote work? Definitely! 47% of freelancers are working remote almost all the time (this is huge when compared to the 12% all-times-remote workers of the entire respondents) 56% of the freelancers prefer to work from home. Interestingly, this ratio is smaller than the 58% of the entire community preferring to work from home. We can have a guess that freelancers have become bored of working from home all the time :).
